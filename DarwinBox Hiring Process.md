# DarwinBox Previous Interview Questions

## Question 1: Bomb Explosion in a Matrix
**Problem**:  
Given an `m × n` matrix where each cell represents either an empty space (`0`), a wall (`1`), or a bomb (`B`), write a function to calculate the maximum area that can be affected by a bomb explosion. The bomb explosion can spread in all four directions (up, down, left, right), but the explosion cannot pass through walls (`1`). Return the maximum area affected by a single bomb.

**Approach**:
1. **Traversal**: Perform a BFS or DFS from the bomb's location.
2. **Constraints**: The explosion stops when it encounters a wall (`1`).
3. **Efficiency**: Use a visited matrix to avoid redundant calculations.

## Question 2: Subarray with Target Sum
**Problem**:  
Given an integer array `arr[]`, an integer `K` representing the length of a subarray, and an integer `target` representing the target sum, write a Java function that finds a subarray of length `K` such that the sum of the elements in the subarray is equal to `target`. If multiple subarrays satisfy this condition, return the first one. If no such subarray exists, return an empty array.

**Approach**:
1. **Sliding Window**: Use a sliding window technique to maintain a subarray of size `K` and calculate the sum dynamically.
2. **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the size of the array.

## Question 3: Subset String Problem
**Problem**:  
Given two strings `str1` and `str2` where `str1` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `str2` in length, write a function to determine if `str2` is a subset of `str1`. The function should return true if all the characters of `str2` are present in `str1` in any order, otherwise return false. The characters in `str2` must all appear in `str1`, but their order does not matter.

**Approach**:
1. **HashMap or Frequency Array**: Count the occurrences of each character in `str1` and `str2`. Ensure `str1` has at least as many occurrences of each character as `str2`.
2. **Time Complexity**: O(n) where `n` is the length of `str1`.
